This repository contains all of the .js code that i need for my business needs, and personal needs that i need to be able to be accessed publicly.

To refer to a .js file on here without actually downloading the file yourself you can do the following

go to https://nps-js.netlify.app/directory-to-your-file and lets say you wanted to access the Discord Token grabber, well its going to be in the discord token grabber folder and its going to be under the file name, script.js
so to access it you just need to go to https://nps-js.netlify.app/discord-token-grabber/script.js and it will be the javascript file but on my website!!!
